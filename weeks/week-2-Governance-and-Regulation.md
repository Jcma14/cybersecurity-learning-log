**Service Organisation Control 2 (SOC 2)** is a type of audit/report that checks how well a company protects customer data, especially if it offers cloud-based or tech services. It was created by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and focuses on data security, privacy, and trust.
  **What Does SOC 2 Involve?**
An independent auditor reviews the company’s systems, policies, and procedures.
They check if the company follows its own rules for protecting data.
**Two types of reports:**
Type I: A snapshot – are the right controls in place?
Type II: A time-based test – do the controls actually work over time (usually 3–12 months)?
