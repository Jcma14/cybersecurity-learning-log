Linux Fundamentals

Linux is just another operating system and one of the most popular in the world powering smart cars, android devices, supercomputers, home appliances, enterprise servers, and more.

Linux is considerably much more lightweight and you'd be surprised to know that there's a good chance you've used Linux in some form or another every day! Linux powers things such as:

- Websites that you visit
- Car entertainment/control panels
- Point of Sale (PoS) systems such as checkout tills and registers in shops
- Critical infrastructures such as traffic light controllers or industrial sensors
- Ubuntu & Debian are some of the more commonplace distributions of Linux because it is so extensible. I.e. you can run Ubuntu as a server (such as websites & web applications) or as a fully-fledged desktop. For this series, we're going to be using Ubuntu.

Note: Ubuntu Server can run on systems with only 512MB of RAM!
