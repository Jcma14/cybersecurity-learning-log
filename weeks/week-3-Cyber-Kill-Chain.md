- **Cyber Kill Chain**
- It consists of target identification, decision and order to attack the target, and finally the target destruction.
- It can be used to assess your network and system security by identifying missing security controls and closing certain security gaps based on a company's infrastructure.
- Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) 
- Attack phases :
- Reconnaissance
- Weaponization
- Delivery
- Exploitation
- Installation
- Command & Control
- Actions on Objectives

-**Reconnaissance** involves identifying and collecting data on systems and victims before launching an attack.
**OSINT** (Open-Source Intelligence) plays a major role, helping attackers gather public information like emails, employee names, and company details.
- Common reconnaissance tactics include email harvesting, used for phishing and other social engineering attacks.
  
- üõ†Ô∏è Tools Studied:

- theHarvester: Gathers emails, subdomains, IPs, URLs, and more.
- Hunter.io: Identifies contact details linked to domains.
- OSINT Framework: A categorized collection of OSINT tools.

-**Weaponization Phase**

Summary:
- After Reconnaissance, the attacker ("Megatron") prepares a malicious payload.
- This phase combines malware + exploit into a deliverable package (no direct victim interaction yet).

Key Concepts:
- **Malware**: Malicious software (e.g., viruses, worms).
- **Exploit**: Code that takes advantage of system vulnerabilities.
- **Payload**: The harmful code executed on the victim‚Äôs system.
- **Weaponizer**: Tool/method to combine malware and exploit.
- **Backdoor**: Secret way to maintain access to the system.
- **C2 (Command & Control)**: Used for remote access and control after infection.

Common Methods:
- Infected Office docs with **macros/VBA scripts**.
- Dropping **malware-infected USB drives** in public.
- Buying malware from the **Dark Web**.
- Creating custom malware to **evade detection** (used by APTs).

-  **What are Macros?**
Macros are small programs that automate tasks in Microsoft Office apps like Excel and Word.
They are useful for repeating steps like formatting, calculations, or document generation.

- **What is VBA?**
VBA stands for Visual Basic for Applications.
It's the programming language used to write macros in Office documents.
Example use: A button in Excel that runs a script to organize your data.

- **Why are Macros/VBA Important in Cybersecurity?**
Attackers often abuse macros to deliver malware.
A malicious Word or Excel file may ask you to "Enable Macros" ‚Äî doing so could run harmful code on your system.
This method is commonly used in phishing attacks to exploit users.

- A **Zero-day exploit** is a cyberattack that takes advantage of a previously unknown vulnerability in software or hardware ‚Äî one that the vendor or developer hasn't had time to fix yet.
- "Zero-day" means the developer has had zero days to fix the flaw because they don‚Äôt know it exists.
- Attackers can exploit it before any patch or protection is available.

Key Takeaway:
Weaponization is a behind-the-scenes phase where the attacker builds or obtains the tools needed to execute the attack.

- **Summary**

**Reconnaissance** ‚Äì The attacker gathers information about the target to find potential vulnerabilities.

**Weaponization** ‚Äì A malicious payload is created, often combining malware with an exploit.

**Delivery** ‚Äì The attacker sends the weaponized payload to the target (e.g., via email or a website).

**Exploitation** ‚Äì The payload exploits a vulnerability to gain access to the system.

**Installation** ‚Äì Malware is installed on the target system to maintain access.

**Command & Control (C2)** ‚Äì The attacker establishes remote control over the compromised system.

**Actions on Objectives** ‚Äì The attacker performs their goal, such as data theft, destruction, or espionage.
