Studied the **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
Learned the principle of **Least Privilege** and **Defense in Depth**
Understood how these concepts apply in real-world systems
## 🔑 Key Concepts
- The CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
- Least Privilege: Only give access that’s necessary
- Defense in Depth: Multiple security layers

## 🧠 Notes
- These principles are the **foundation** of everything in cybersecurity
- “Least Privilege” really reminds me of real life: don’t give admin access to everyone

## 🤔 Confusions
- How is “Defense in Depth” implemented practically? More research needed.

## 💡 Reflection
Understanding these now helps me see why businesses take certain security steps.
